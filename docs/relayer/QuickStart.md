# How To Become Relayer

## Step 1: Insure your account has sufficient balance

#### In order to join election, the account balance should have 100000 MAP at least. Then using 100000 MAP to register at contract.

## Step 2: Join relayer election 

#### When balance is more 100000 MAP at contract, the validitor will join election at election point that it is block number that counts backwards 200 at a multiple of ten thousand generally.
#### It is Auto-completion by our system. the validitor is 100% selected at first times, only if the list of being selected isn't full.   
#### Notify! It wants to join election this term, the validitor should register before election point.

## Step 3: Wait for election result

#### Above introduce, the election point is block number that counts backwards 200 at a multiple of ten thousand generally.
#### After election point, it can query that the validitor is selected or not. But the selected validitor start to work at Epoch started point, i.e. block number is a multiple of ten thousand.

## Step 4: Synchronize enough block

#### If the validiter isn't registered first, it wants to become relayer continue that needs to complete enough workload.
#### In order to reappointment, the current relayers need to synchronize 10000 blocks from other blockchain to atlas.

## Step 5: Withdraw your registered asset

#### If the validitor wants to quit, it should unregister balance at contract. The balance will be locked at this epoch and next epoch.
#### After two epochs, it will add to unlocked balance, can withdraw directly from the contract.
